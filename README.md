**Overview**
This project, “DesignaRecipe”, is a Recipe Management Application developed in C# using Visual Studio. It started as a command-line application and grew into a GUI-based WPF application through iterative improvements. The project demonstrates key programming concepts such as string manipulation, collections, delegates, unit testing, and GUI development with WPF.
Features & Implementation

**Phase 1:** Console-Based Application
* Implemented a standalone command-line application.
* Required user input to add and manage recipes.
* Used string manipulation techniques to process recipe details.
* Implemented automatic properties in C#.
* Stored ingredients and steps in arrays.
* Followed international coding standards with detailed comments.
* Maintained source code in a GitHub repository with regular, descriptive commits.

**Phase 2:** Enhancements with Collections and Delegates
* Replaced arrays with generic collections (e.g., List<T>) for storing:
    * Recipes
    * Ingredients
    * Steps
* Introduced delegates to notify users when a recipe exceeds 300 calories.
* Implemented unit testing to validate the total calorie calculation.

**Phase 3:** Graphical User Interface (GUI) with WPF
* Upgraded the application to a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) GUI.
* Implemented controls to create an interactive user interface.
* Applied styles for an enhanced user experience and added to a more visually appealing application.

**Technologies Used**
* Programming Language: C#
* Development Environment: Visual Studio
* Frameworks & Libraries:
    * Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
    * NUnit (for unit testing)

**Key Learnings**
* Writing structured, maintainable console applications.
* Utilising collections for efficient data management.
* Implementing delegates for event-driven programming.
* Conducting unit testing for accuracy in calculations.
* Developed graphical user interfaces with WPF.
